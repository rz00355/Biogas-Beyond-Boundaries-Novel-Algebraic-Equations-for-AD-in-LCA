# Biogas-Beyond-Boundaries-Novel-Algebraic-Equations-for-AD-in-LCA
Biogas, derived from carbon-neutral organic waste, offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. Life cycle assessments (LCA) are crucial for evaluating the global warming potential (GWP) of biogas, ensuring its effectiveness in offsetting fossil fuel equivalents. 

Amidst the growing interest in biogas as a sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources like natural gas, this study delves into its pivotal role in achieving net-zero targets, where carbon emissions are balanced with sequestration. Biogas, derived from carbon-neutral organic waste, presents a promising avenue for substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
